# This folder contains software for computing Thorpe scales/overturns.

The basic idea of Thorpe scales/overturns is to resort profiles of temperature or density to form a stable profile, and assuming any inversions(overturns) were produced by turbulent eddies. Turbulent mixing can then be estimated using the size of the overturns, the stratification, and several other assumptions.
