# Standard-Mixing-Routines
Repository for standard software used by Oceanography community

This repository is inteded to be a repo for "best-practices" software used to perform standard calculations in the Oceanographic mixing community (such as Thorpe scales, finescale parameterizations etc).

We are just starting this repo and getting input from the community about how it should be set up. Please hold off on creating anything new for now. If you have any suggestions, we would love to hear them. Email andypicke (at) gmail (dot) com . Thanks!
