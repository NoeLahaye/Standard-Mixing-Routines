# Standard-Mixing-Routines
Repository for standard software used by oceanographic mixing community.

This repository is inteded to be a repo for "best-practices" software used to perform standard calculations in the Oceanographic mixing community (such as Thorpe scales, finescale parameterizations etc).

We are just starting this repo and getting input from the community about how it should be set up. Please hold off on creating anything new for now. If you have any suggestions, we would love to hear them. Email andypicke (at) gmail (dot) com . Thanks!


## How to Contribute
* You can upload code to <https://www.dropbox.com/request/s0pWpFVFkdijwEQQMl0K>
* Eventually we envision that everyone in the community will contribute and help maintain the repository. But at first we think it will be easier for a small group to upload and organize things.
* Find a bug or problem with codes? Open an 'issue' to notify team members and create an official record.
* Want to make changes? First, 'fork' the repository (make your own separate copy), then make changes, then open a 'pull request'. Once approved, it can be merged into the master branch.
* Don't use git often and don't want to remember all the terminal commands? Download GitHub for desktop <https://desktop.github.com/>, a nice and easy to use front-end.

## Possible topics
* Thorpe Scales / overturns
* Finescale Parameterizations (shear/strain)
* Calculation of stratification
* Theoretical spectra (Batchelor/Kraichnan)
* Small sample datasets that can be used to test code and compare results vs other versions.
* Summaries of sensitivity studies, method comparisons etc.
